"The state of Missouri is a pioneer in adopting Diverging Diamond Interchanges (DDIs) named for their innovative design. At these interchanges drivers are diverted to the left side of the road prior to merging onto an interstate, freeway or highway. The first such interchange in the U.S. opened in Springfield, Mo. in 2009. Recent studies from the University of Missouri have found that these unusual designs are safer and save lives."
"Statewide implementation of DDIs has been investigated mostly by MU civil engineers who recently published three studies analyzing the safety of these inventive designs. By analyzing more than 10,000 crash reports of DDIs in Missouri and in states that have adopted the designs, civil engineers have determined that overall crashes decreased by more than 50 percent nationwide. Additionally, fatal and injury crashes decreased by more than 70 percent, proving these cutting-edge designs are efficient, effective and life-saving."
"Unlike conventional interchanges at which drivers always stay in the right lane and make wide left turns onto the overpass, DDIs are considered safer because they utilize all left turns and decrease crashes at crucial interchanges (see photo). DDIs divert drivers exiting major thoroughfares by requiring traffic on an overpass or underpass to drive on the left side of the trafficway, improving safety by eliminating left-turning conflicts common in diamond interchanges; traffic flow is optimized through traffic signals."
"""Before our studies, little information was available about the safety effects of diverging diamonds,"" said Carlos Sun, professor of civil and environmental engineering in the MU College of Engineering. ""Two of our research studies analyzed several years of crash data and controlled for several variables, including traffic amounts, to account for safety of the interchanges before and after they became DDIs while taking into account DDI ramp lengths, giving us a more complete and robust sample of results that we feel is very comprehensive."""
"Henry Brown, a civil research engineer at MU, was lead author on a third study that investigated common practices for diverting traffic while constructing and later maintaining geometric interchanges, which included DDIs. Brown and the team surveyed project managers on construction and maintenance projects for a variety of interchanges to see which practices tended to work the best and poured over construction plans to establish a set of best practices for the various interchanges."
"""There's very little guidance out there on how workers can safely divert drivers and change traffic patterns while implementing DDIs, roundabouts and other designs,"" Brown said. ""If workers are retrofitting a diamond interchange, they're actually completely changing the traffic pattern and that just can't happen by flipping a switch; it takes careful planning."""
"Sun, Brown and the team determined that crews should build the interchanges in phases and then close them briefly to install signage to alert drivers to the change in traffic flow. Their study provides real-world guidance to traffic workers and teams as they implement safer traffic designs. ""Maintenance of Traffic for Innovative Geometric Designs Work Zones,"" recently was published in the Transportation Research Record, Praveen Edara, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at MU, and Tim Kope and Amir Khezerzadeh, students in the MU College of Engineering, co-authored the paper."

"Rima Taher, an expert in the design of low-rise buildings for extreme winds and hurricane, hopes her phone won't ring much this hurricane season. It's already been busy with requests for information about best building design and construction practices to reduce wind pressures on building surfaces."
"In the aftermath of the January earthquake in Haiti, Taher, a civil and structural engineer at the NJIT College of Architecture and Design, prepared a document for Architecture for Humanity about best building practices for hurricane and earthquake-prone areas. It's posted on the organization's Haiti Reconstruction website and still circulates in Haiti. More recently, she cooperated with wind researchers at Tokyo Polytechnic University, Japan, to develop and translate from French a brochure for UNESCO to help Haitians prepare for the upcoming hurricane season. UNESCO will distribute the brochure in Haiti."
"In 2007 Taher's article about the design of low-rise buildings for extreme wind events appeared in the Journal of Architectural Engineering of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Another article on improved building practices for hurricanes appeared in Caribbean Construction Magazine in July of 2009."
"""Certain home shapes and roof types can make a big difference,"" is a common refrain in all her work."
"Her recommendations include the following."
"* Design buildings with square, hexagonal or even octagonal floor plans with roofs of multiple slopes such as a four-sloped hip roof. These roofs perform better under wind forces than the gable roofs with two slopes. Gable roofs are common only because they are cheaper to build. Research and testing demonstrate that a 30-degree roof slope will have the best results."
"* Wind forces on a roof tend to uplift it. ""This explains why roofs blow off during extreme wind events,"" Taher said. To combat uplift, she advises connecting roofs to walls strongly with nails, not staples. Stapled roofs were banned in Florida after Hurricane Andrew. The use of hurricane clips is recommended. The choice of roofing is important. Different roofing systems perform differently under hurricane conditions. In tile roofs, loose tiles often become wind-borne debris threatening other structures."
"* Aim for strong connections between the structure and foundation. Structural failure-- one structural element triggering the collapse of another -- can be progressive."
"* Hurricane shutters can protect glazing from wind-borne debris. Various designs are available."
"* Roof overhangs are subject to wind uplift forces which could trigger a roof failure. In the design of the hurricane-resistant home, the length of these overhangs should be limited to about 20 inches."
"* The design of the researched cyclonic home includes simple systems to reduce the local wind stresses at the roof's lower edges such as a notched frieze or a horizontal grid. Install the latter at the level of the gutters along the homes' perimeter."
"* An elevated structure on an open foundation reduces the risk of damage from flooding and storm-driven water. All foundation piles must be strengthened by bracing and should penetrate deep enough into the soil to reduce the risk of scour."
